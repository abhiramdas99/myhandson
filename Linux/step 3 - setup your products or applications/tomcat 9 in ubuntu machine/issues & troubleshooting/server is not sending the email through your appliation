The problem was with the last versions of Java.

I had installed openjdk 1.8.0_292, since _291, doesn't allow TLS 1.0 and 1.1, protocol that Gmail has by default until today.

So, to be able to solve my problem without install another versions of java, I had edited the file /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/security/java.security

And commented that part:

#jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, \
#DH keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL, \
#include jdk.disabled.namedCurves
And add this part right after:

jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, \
DH keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL, \
include jdk.disabled.namedCurves1
As you can see, the java had explicity disabled some protocols, returning the COULD NOT CONVERT SOCKET TO TLS error. 
Hope this help others who may find that problem.
